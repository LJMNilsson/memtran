Memtran is supposed to become a compiled language with automatic memory management, but without any tracing garbage collector (and no ref counting either). Imperative, open source. 

It is very far from completed, but I provide it here anyway. We will see how far I can take it.  

The Memtran compiler is provided under the GPL version 3. User level documentation is provided under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license (see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode ). Standard libraries, if any, will be licensed under the MIT license. Further, the compiler will interface LLVM, which comes with its own licensing terms.
